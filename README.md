# Chao_Chatterz
A repository with the latest public source for the [BYOND](http://www.byond.com/) game [Chao Chatterz](http://www.byond.com/games/GoldDean/ChaoChatterz). It was originally made by [Gold Dean](http://www.byond.com/members/GoldDean) and publicly released on August 30, 2005. The latest update by Gold Dean was released on December 10, 2013. Chao Chatterz is an open-world roleplaying game with the real limits being the map-size and your imagination.

Once I have time to get around to it, I'll begin making efforts to update parts of the code to be better ran in the latest versions of BYOND.
